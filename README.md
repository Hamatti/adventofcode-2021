# Advent of Code 2021

Santa and the elves need our help again. [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a Christmas advent calendar of daily puzzles that can be solved by writing code.

[Last year](https://github.com/Hamatti/adventofcode-2020) I picked up Rust to learn a new language and made a personal record of 15 stars.

This year I'm planning to use Python with Jupyter Notebook.

## Results

- [Day 1](/src/day_1.ipynb): ⭐️⭐️

## Jupyter Notebook

1. Activate virtualenv:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Run Jupyter Notebook server

```

3. Convert to HTML

```
jupyter nbconvert to=html [notebook]
```
