# Advent of Code 2021

Santa and the elves need our help again. [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a Christmas advent calendar of daily puzzles that can be solved by writing code.

[Last year](https://github.com/Hamatti/adventofcode-2020) I picked up Rust to learn a new language and made a personal record of 15 stars.

This year I'm planning to use Python.

I'm also planning to livestream my programming on [my Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFTR0aya8Bhzf3WIT4VwLeA) so subscribe to that if you want to know when it happens!
