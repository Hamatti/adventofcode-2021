    "> You finally decode the Elves' message. `HI`, the message says. You continue searching for the sleigh keys.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Ahead of you is what appears to be a large ocean trench. Could the keys have fallen into it? You'd better send a probe to investigate.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The probe launcher on your submarine can fire the probe with any integer velocity in the x (forward) and y (upward, or downward if negative) directions. For example, an initial x,y velocity like `0,10` would fire the probe straight up, while an initial velocity like `10,-1` would fire the probe forward at a slight downward angle.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The probe's x,y position starts at `0,0`. Then, it will follow some trajectory by moving in steps. On each step, these changes occur in the following order:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">- The probe's `x` position increases by its `x` velocity.\n",
    ">- The probe's `y` position increases by its `y` velocity.\n",
    ">- Due to drag, the probe's `x` velocity changes by `1` toward the value `0`; that is, it decreases by `1` if it is greater than `0`, increases by `1` if it is less than `0`, or does not change if it is already `0`.\n",
    ">- Due to gravity, the probe's `y` velocity decreases by `1`.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">For the probe to successfully make it into the trench, the probe must be on some trajectory that causes it to be within a target area after any step. The submarine computer has already calculated this target area (your puzzle input). For example:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">```\n",
    "target area: x=20..30, y=-10..-5\n",
    ">```\n",
    ">\n",
    ">This target area means that you need to find initial x,y velocity values such that after any step, the probe's x position is at least 20 and at most 30, and the probe's y position is at least -10 and at most -5.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Given this target area, one initial velocity that causes the probe to be within the target area after any step is `7,2`:\n",
