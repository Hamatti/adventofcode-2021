    "# Day 7 - The Treachery of Whales\n",
    "\n",
    "A giant squid, trillions of lanternfish and now there's a whale and swarm of crabs in tiny submarines too! \n",
    "\n",
    ">A giant whale has decided your submarine is its next meal, and it's much faster than you are. There's nowhere to run!\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Suddenly, a swarm of crabs (each in its own tiny submarine - it's too deep for them otherwise) zooms in to rescue you! They seem to be preparing to blast a hole in the ocean floor; sensors indicate a massive underground cave system just beyond where they're aiming!\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The crab submarines all need to be aligned before they'll have enough power to blast a large enough hole for your submarine to get through. However, it doesn't look like they'll be aligned before the whale catches you! Maybe you can help?\n",
    ">\n",
    ">There's one major catch - crab submarines can only move horizontally.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">You quickly make a list of the horizontal position of each crab (your puzzle input). Crab submarines have limited fuel, so you need to find a way to make all of their horizontal positions match while requiring them to spend as little fuel as possible.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">For example, consider the following horizontal positions:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">`16,1,2,0,4,2,7,1,2,14`\n",
    ">\n",
    ">This means there's a crab with horizontal position 16, a crab with horizontal position 1, and so on.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Each change of 1 step in horizontal position of a single crab costs 1 fuel. You could choose any horizontal position to align them all on, but the one that costs the least fuel is horizontal position 2:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">- Move from 16 to 2: 14 fuel\n",
    ">- Move from 1 to 2: 1 fuel\n",
    ">- Move from 2 to 2: 0 fuel\n",
    ">- Move from 0 to 2: 2 fuel\n",
    ">- Move from 4 to 2: 2 fuel\n",
    ">- Move from 2 to 2: 0 fuel\n",
    ">- Move from 7 to 2: 5 fuel\n",
    ">- Move from 1 to 2: 1 fuel\n",
    ">- Move from 2 to 2: 0 fuel\n",
    ">- Move from 14 to 2: 12 fuel\n",
    ">\n",
    ">This costs a total of 37 fuel. This is the cheapest possible outcome; more expensive outcomes include aligning at position 1 (41 fuel), position 3 (39 fuel), or position 10 (71 fuel).\n",
