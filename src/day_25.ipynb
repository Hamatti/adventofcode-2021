    "# Day 25 - Sea Cucumber\n",

    ">This is it: the bottom of the ocean trench, the last place the sleigh keys could be. Your submarine's experimental antenna still isn't boosted enough to detect the keys, but they must be here. All you need to do is reach the seafloor and find them.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">At least, you'd touch down on the seafloor if you could; unfortunately, it's completely covered by two large herds of sea cucumbers, and there isn't an open space large enough for your submarine.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">You suspect that the Elves must have done this before, because just then you discover the phone number of a deep-sea marine biologist on a handwritten note taped to the wall of the submarine's cockpit.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">\"Sea cucumbers? Yeah, they're probably hunting for food. But don't worry, they're predictable critters: they move in perfectly straight lines, only moving forward when there's space to do so. They're actually quite polite!\"\n",
    ">\n",
    ">You explain that you'd like to predict when you could land your submarine.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">\"Oh that's easy, they'll eventually pile up and leave enough space for-- wait, did you say submarine? And the only place with that many sea cucumbers would be at the very bottom of the Mariana--\" You hang up the phone.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">There are two herds of sea cucumbers sharing the same region; one always moves east (>), while the other always moves south (v). Each location can contain at most one sea cucumber; the remaining locations are empty (.). The submarine helpfully generates a map of the situation (your puzzle input). For example:\n",
