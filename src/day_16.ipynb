    "# Day 16 - Packet Decoder\n",
    "\n",
    ">As you leave the cave and reach open waters, you receive a transmission from the Elves back on the ship.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The transmission was sent using the Buoyancy Interchange Transmission System (BITS), a method of packing numeric expressions into a binary sequence. Your submarine's computer has saved the transmission in hexadecimal (your puzzle input).\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The first step of decoding the message is to convert the hexadecimal representation into binary. Each character of hexadecimal corresponds to four bits of binary data:\n",
    ">```\n",
    "0 = 0000\n",
    "1 = 0001\n",
    "2 = 0010\n",
    "3 = 0011\n",
    "4 = 0100\n",
    "5 = 0101\n",
    "6 = 0110\n",
    "7 = 0111\n",
    "8 = 1000\n",
    "9 = 1001\n",
    "A = 1010\n",
    "B = 1011\n",
    "C = 1100\n",
    "D = 1101\n",
    "E = 1110\n",
    "F = 1111\n",
    ">```\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The BITS transmission contains a single packet at its outermost layer which itself contains many other packets. The hexadecimal representation of this packet might encode a few extra 0 bits at the end; these are not part of the transmission and should be ignored.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Every packet begins with a standard header: the first three bits encode the packet version, and the next three bits encode the packet type ID. These two values are numbers; all numbers encoded in any packet are represented as binary with the most significant bit first. For example, a version encoded as the binary sequence 100 represents the number 4.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Packets with type ID 4 represent a literal value. Literal value packets encode a single binary number. To do this, the binary number is padded with leading zeroes until its length is a multiple of four bits, and then it is broken into groups of four bits. Each group is prefixed by a 1 bit except the last group, which is prefixed by a 0 bit. These groups of five bits immediately follow the packet header. For example, the hexadecimal string D2FE28 becomes:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">```\n",
    "110100101111111000101000\n",
    "VVVTTTAAAAABBBBBCCCCC\n",
    ">```\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Below each bit is a label indicating its purpose:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">- The three bits labeled V (110) are the packet version, 6.\n",
    ">- The three bits labeled T (100) are the packet type ID, 4, which means the packet is a literal value.\n",
    ">- The five bits labeled A (10111) start with a 1 (not the last group, keep reading) and contain the first four bits of the number, 0111.\n",
    ">- The five bits labeled B (11110) start with a 1 (not the last group, keep reading) and contain four more bits of the number, 1110.\n",
    ">- The five bits labeled C (00101) start with a 0 (last group, end of packet) and contain the last four bits of the number, 0101.\n",
    ">- The three unlabeled 0 bits at the end are extra due to the hexadecimal representation and should be ignored.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">So, this packet represents a literal value with binary representation 011111100101, which is 2021 in decimal.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Every other type of packet (any packet with a type ID other than 4) represent an operator that performs some calculation on one or more sub-packets contained within. Right now, the specific operations aren't important; focus on parsing the hierarchy of sub-packets.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">An operator packet contains one or more packets. To indicate which subsequent binary data represents its sub-packets, an operator packet can use one of two modes indicated by the bit immediately after the packet header; this is called the length type ID:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">- If the length type ID is 0, then the next 15 bits are a number that represents the total length in bits of the sub-packets contained by this packet.\n",
    ">- If the length type ID is 1, then the next 11 bits are a number that represents the number of sub-packets immediately contained by this packet.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Finally, after the length type ID bit and the 15-bit or 11-bit field, the sub-packets appear.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">For example, here is an operator packet (hexadecimal string 38006F45291200) with length type ID 0 that contains two sub-packets:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">```\n",
    "00111000000000000110111101000101001010010001001000000000\n",
    "VVVTTTILLLLLLLLLLLLLLLAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB\n",
    ">```\n",
    ">\n",
    ">- The three bits labeled V (001) are the packet version, 1.\n",
    ">- The three bits labeled T (110) are the packet type ID, 6, which means the packet is an operator.\n",
    ">- The bit labeled I (0) is the length type ID, which indicates that the length is a 15-bit number representing the number of bits in the sub-packets.\n",
    ">- The 15 bits labeled L (000000000011011) contain the length of the sub-packets in bits, 27.\n",
    ">- The 11 bits labeled A contain the first sub-packet, a literal value representing the number 10.\n",
    ">- The 16 bits labeled B contain the second sub-packet, a literal value representing the number 20.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">After reading 11 and 16 bits of sub-packet data, the total length indicated in L (27) is reached, and so parsing of this packet stops.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">As another example, here is an operator packet (hexadecimal string EE00D40C823060) with length type ID 1 that contains three sub-packets:\n",
    ">```\n",
    "11101110000000001101010000001100100000100011000001100000\n",
    "VVVTTTILLLLLLLLLLLAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBBBBCCCCCCCCCCC\n",
    ">```\n",
    ">\n",
    ">- The three bits labeled V (111) are the packet version, 7.\n",
    ">- The three bits labeled T (011) are the packet type ID, 3, which means the packet is an operator.\n",
    ">- The bit labeled I (1) is the length type ID, which indicates that the length is a 11-bit number representing the number of sub-packets.\n",
    ">- The 11 bits labeled L (00000000011) contain the number of sub-packets, 3.\n",
    ">- The 11 bits labeled A contain the first sub-packet, a literal value representing the number 1.\n",
    ">- The 11 bits labeled B contain the second sub-packet, a literal value representing the number 2.\n",
    ">- The 11 bits labeled C contain the third sub-packet, a literal value representing the number 3.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">After reading 3 complete sub-packets, the number of sub-packets indicated in L (3) is reached, and so parsing of this packet stops.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">For now, parse the hierarchy of the packets throughout the transmission and add up all of the version numbers.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Here are a few more examples of hexadecimal-encoded transmissions:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">- `8A004A801A8002F478` represents an operator packet (version 4) which contains an operator packet (version 1) which contains an operator packet (version 5) which contains a literal value (version 6); this packet has a version sum of 16.\n",
    ">- `620080001611562C8802118E34` represents an operator packet (version 3) which contains two sub-packets; each sub-packet is an operator packet that contains two literal values. This packet has a version sum of 12.\n",
    ">- `C0015000016115A2E0802F182340` has the same structure as the previous example, but the outermost packet uses a different length type ID. This packet has a version sum of 23.\n",
    ">- `A0016C880162017C3686B18A3D4780` is an operator packet that contains an operator packet that contains an operator packet that contains five literal values; it has a version sum of 31.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Decode the structure of your hexadecimal-encoded BITS transmission; what do you get if you add up the version numbers in all packets?"
